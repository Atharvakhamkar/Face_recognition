ðŸš€ This is a Face recognition  python code wwhich is used to detect the face which is shown 

ðŸŽ¯ The required dependencies are :
â—‰  import cv2
â—‰  import face_recognition
â—‰  pip install cmake  // which might give an error check out ""youtube""

ðŸ”” In this the file structure is important where we have to give the datasets (images) as an per data i.e is which is used to identify the person .


ðŸŽ¯  You can change the images as per your needs 

        ** REMEMBER **
You should save the images as per the name of the person with the file extension , and put it in a array of "" known_image"" in the code 

** THIS WILL NOT WORK FOR OTHER THINGS SUCH AS NON-LIVING THINGS **

Only for face recognition
